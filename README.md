# Akan Names Resolver Project

## Project Description
This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 
Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.

## Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- Git  
- JAVASCRIPT  
- BOOTSTRAP  

## BDD
- Enter year of Birth eg 2019 Input >Example 2019 Output Example 2019

- Enter month of birth eg 5 for May Input >Example 5 Output example 5

- Enter Day of the month the user was born in eg 11 Input >Example 11 Output example 11

Submit. Upon submission, the program checks the inputs against the conditions set for the inputs and executes the program if all are met else an alert is sent to the user to enter valid deatils.


## Roadmap

This project can be advanced from a web application to a mobile app for ease of access and increase its usage.
